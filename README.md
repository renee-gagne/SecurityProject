### Welcome!

### This project focuses on predictive modeling for malware presence on machines using logistic regression and random forest models. The dataset used for this project derives from Kaggle's Microsoft Malware Prediction competition, found at:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data

###  Note that this project consists of two primary documents:

#### 1: An .ipynb file which has both the python code and annotated markdown explaining the process followed

#### 2: A report outlining the modeling process and key findings
